# Collaborative Filtering for Movie Recommendation based on Users Interest

- This notebook implements a movie recommender system.
- Recommender systems are used to suggest movies or songs to users based on their interest or usage history.
- For example, Netflix recommends movies to watch based on the previous movies you've watched.

## THE MAIN APPROACH 
•	Applied item-based collaborative filtering that will correlate movies based on different users’ behaviour.\
•	First performed item-based collaborative filtering on one movie sample and then computed the correlation between each movie and the entire matrix (Dataset).
- Finally created an item-based collaborative filter on the entire dataset and obtained the correlations between all the movies in the data frame.
